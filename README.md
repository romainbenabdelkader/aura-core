# AURA Core

AURA Core defines a minimal evidentiary manifest format for digital content.

Its purpose is to establish verifiable facts about a digital asset:

- existence at a given point in time
  
- integrity (content hash)
  
- attribution claims (who declares what)
  
- temporal assertions (when the declaration was made)

AURA Core is deliberately minimal.

It is designed to be:

- evidentiary only
  
- non-executive
  
- non-enforcing
  
- platform-independent
  
- usable without any central authority

AURA Core does NOT:

- prove legal ownership or legitimacy
  
- enforce rights or permissions
  
- prevent copying or scraping
  
- monitor usage or diffusion
  
- replace legal or judicial processes

It constrains the space of dispute by making factual claims explicit,
verifiable, and portable.

This repository contains the core specification of the AURA manifest
format. Implementations, tools, operators, and services are explicitly
out of scope.
